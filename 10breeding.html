<h1>Breeding</h1>
<h3>10.1 Mating System</h3>
<p>Australian Water Dragons are socially arranged into harem groups consisting of a single adult male, several females and various immature offspring. All animals stay within a home range with males defending against interlopers and dispersing maturing offspring through aggressive displays and combat (Thompson 1993).</p>

<h3>10.2 Ease of Breeding</h3>
<p>This species will breed readily in captivity as long as males and females are of breeding age, good health and sufficient space is provided. Females also need adequate nesting substrates and a selection of temperatures in order to dig test holes and select nesting sites.</p>

<h3>10.3 Reproductive Condition</h3>
<h4>10.3.1 Females</h4>
<p>Female Water Dragons show reproductive condition by at least 4-5 years of age. However in captivity, where food intake and conditions are more stable than the wild, young Water Dragons are able to grow faster, attain adult size and become mature at as young as 13 months (Harlow and Harlow 1997:17). Females will increase food intake following cooler periods. After mating, as the eggs develop in the gravid female, she will spend increasing time basking (Goulding and Green 2006:27).</p>

<h4>10.3.2 Males</h4>
<p>Increased activity including domination displays towards other males and male combat (See Reproductive Behaviour in Section 9.3). Male Eastern Water Dragons, <em>I.  l. lesueurii</em> develop scarlet colouration on the chest from the neck to the vent, Gippsland Water Dragon, <em>I.  l. lesueurii</em>, males develop black, yellow/orange and blue markings as well as green or blue colouration on the ventral surface (Aland 2008:463).  Males of both subspecies will perform courtship displays towards females which include waving (or saluting) and stamping of the forearms and head bobbing displays towards females (Goulding and Green 2006:27).</p>

<h3>10.4 Techniques Used to Control Breeding</h3>
<p>Breeding should only be controlled by means of housing same-sex groups together over the breeding season as breeding control is not possible chemically and not necessary through surgery. Keepers should be aware of the species ability to store sperm within a single breeding season, therefore viable eggs may be laid up to four months after the female has been separated from mature males. Keeping only juvenile animals as display animals is another way to prevent offspring however it is not a long term solution to controlling breeding as the animals grow older.</p>

<h3>10.5 Occurrence of Hybrids</h3>
<p>Some individuals occurring in Kangaroo Valley appear to show mixtures of features from both <em>I.  l. lesueurii</em> and <I>I. l. howittii</I> subspecies (Rankin in Anonymous 1976:22). This is expected since it is the southern limit and northern limit for each subspecies respectively. Such crossing of subspecies may occur in captivity if keepers are not aware of the differences between the subspecies and are not identified as such. There are no records of hybridization between <em>I. lesueurii</em> and <em>P. cocincinus</em> or any other related species.</p>

<h3>10.6 Timing of Breeding</h3>
<p>The timing of breeding is determined by the onset of warmer weather in spring which occurs sooner in populations occurring in north Queensland and later in populations living in Gippsland. In the Sydney region, the breeding season begins after the brumation period begins in September when courtship and mating begins and concludes in January when the last clutches of eggs are laid (Greer 2006:76).</p>

<h3>10.7 Age at First Breeding and Last Breeding</h3>
<p>Males are thought to be sexually mature at a snout-vent length of about 210mm and a mass of 400g (Thompson 1993:) In the wild this occurs at approximately 5 years of age in captivity this can occur as early as 2 years. Harlow and Harlow (1997:15) recorded the first breeding in a single female at four years of age and last breeding for the same individual at 27 years of age. It is unclear how long males can reproduce.</p>

<h3>10.8 Ability to Breed Every Year</h3>
<p>Harlow and Harlow (1997:15) recorded a single female which bred during 22 out of 23 seasons between 1971 and 1993, it is therefore likely that this species can breed every year at least in captivity under optimal conditions. Wild female <em>I. l. lesueurii</em> were palpated in one field study to detect the presence or absence of oviducal eggs (Thompson 1993:617). The results were a low proportion of oviducal eggs, indicating that female Water Dragons do not breed every year in the wild.</p>

<p>Malformed infertile eggs have been recorded being laid by the captive female mentioned above during the only breeding season when there was no male access (Harlow and Harlow 1997:15)</p>

<h3>10.9 Ability to Breed More than Once Per Year</h3>
<p>Females can reproduce twice a season in captivity (Harlow, in Anonymous, 1976), however this was not recorded as occurring in the wild based mark and recapture research by Thompson (1993:617). A captive female <em>I. l. lesueurii</em> recorded by Harlow and Harlow (1997:15) laid her first double clutch at the snout-vent length of 178mm and laid two clutches for twenty consecutive breeding seasons until her last season in 1993 when a single clutch was laid. On two occasions this same female produced a second clutch without being mated between laying the first and second clutch, demonstrating this species’ ability to store sperm within a breeding season (Harlow and Harlow 1997:16).</p>

<h3>10.10 Nesting, Hollow or Other Requirements</h3>
<p>Females begin digging test holes in sandy soil from a week to three days prior to laying (Hay 1972:2). Records collected of the nesting behaviour of a single female by Harlow and Harlow (1997:15-16) showed interesting breeding behavioural observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eggs were laid on days when the daily maximum temperature and global radiation (which indicates the total amount of the sun’s energy which arrives at ground level) measurements was higher than those of ten days previous.</li>
<li>Test burrows were observed being dug up to a week prior to actual ovipositing.</li>
<li>Burrows would be dug at all times of the day, however the majority of digging activity was undertaken during the last two hours before sunset.</li>
<li>Actual egg laying would similarly only occur in the last few hours before sunset. During which time the female would become increasingly wary and freeze at the slightest disturbance.</li>
<li>Upon digging the nesting burrow the female would investigate the depth and temperature with snout.</li>
<li>The female laid the eggs lying flat over the hole to deposit the eggs with her entire body exposed. The front limbs were used to excavate and the hind limbs were used to back fill the nest.</li>
<li>Dried grass was scattered over the hole once filled to disguise the nests location.</li>
</ul>
<p>Harlow and Harlow (1997:16) also described that this usually placid female would defend the nesting site very aggressively, biting any person or other lizard that would approach the nest. Wild nest temperatures of <em>Intellagama lesueurii</em> (presumably <em>I. l. howittii</em> although not stated in the literature) were recorded by Meek et al (2001) at the Australian Botanical Gardens in Canberra. Results showed that nest temperature remained relatively constant (23.7-29.2ºC daily averages) despite high levels of temperature fluctuations (25-50ºC) on the surface (Meek et al 2001:26-7).</p>

<h3>10.11 Breeding Diet</h3>
<p>No change in diet is required to induce breeding however Water Dragons do naturally increase their feeding at the onset of spring after the cooling period therefore lizards should be provided with an increased quantity and even frequency of food, however it should be nutritionally balanced as described in section 6. Females will be seen basking more often to digest food while eggs are developing (Goulding and Green 2006:29).</p>

<h3>10.12 Incubation Period</h3>
<p>The incubation period ranges from 68-120 days (Harlow and Harlow 1997:19, Greer 2006:76). The maximum incubation period of 120 days was recorded in a nest incubated at room temperature (Harlow and Harlow 1997:17). It should be noted that all of these figures were recorded from <em>I. l. lesueurii</em> and that the other subspecies <em>P. l. howittii</em>, may have a different incubation period range.</p>

<h3>10.13 Clutch Size</h3>
<p>Water Dragon clutch sizes range from 6 to 18 eggs (Harlow and Maddox in Anonymous 1976:20-1, Harlow and Harlow 1997:19). Mean mass of individual eggs varies from about 4.0 to 5.1g (Harlow and Harlow 1997:19).</p>

<h3>10.14 Age at Weaning</h3>
<p>Not applicable to reptiles.</p>

<h3>10.15 Age of Removal from Parents</h3>
<p>Not applicable to reptiles.</p>

<h3>10.16 Growth and Development</h3>
<p>Growth is highest in the first year with hatchlings from a mark and recapture project growing 2.25mm or 1.25g per month (Thomson 1993:613). One juvenile individual was measured in its first season in March 1990, 78mm from snout to vent (SVL) and weighed 17g. The following year in January this same individual had a SVL of 101mm and was 34g (Thomson 1993:616).</p>
