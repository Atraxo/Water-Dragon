<h1>5 General Husbandry</h1>

<h3>5.1 Hygiene and Cleaning</h3>

<p>Uneaten food and faeces should be removed on a daily basis. A weekly cleaning schedule should include cleaning cage surfaces such as branches, viewing windows and walls with a veterinary grade cleaning product such as F10 as well as replacement of any damaged plants.</p>

<p>Every six months the substrate should be completely removed and a stronger cleaning solution such as diluted bleach should be applied to all enclosure surfaces 	and rinsed clean. If possible substrate such as soil and mulch should be heat treated in a microwave, oven or left in the sun in a black garbage bag for 12 hours. Substrate such as pebbles and gravel should be thoroughly washed with detergent, rinsed well and left in the sun to dry.</p>

<p>Depending on the size of pool and filtration system used, water should be drained, pool scrubbed out with diluted bleach, rinsed and re-filled. This should be done on a weekly basis for pools without filtration and every six months for pools that have an advanced filtration system.</p>

<h3>5.2 Record Keeping</h3>
<p>A record sheet for each enclosure or group of enclosures should be kept in a secure area close to the enclosure(s). Ideally for inside situations the record sheet should be attached to the enclosure or access point. Dated information such as feeding, watering, shedding and behaviour notes should be recorded in writing on a daily basis. Other information that should be recorded include any noticeable health problems, veterinary examinations and treatments, reproductive events (courtship, displays between individuals, signs of aggression, matings or attempted matings and egg laying), skin sloughing, changes in diet (noting actual food eaten not just what was offered), weights and measurements and internal as well as external transfers. All records must be dated and identified as to which staff member recorded the observation.<p>

<h3>5.3 Methods of Identification</h3>
<p>Although females and males can be identified, Australian Water Dragons may be kept in groups consisting of multiple males and females where adequate space is provided. Although markings do differ between individuals of the same sex the most reliable way to identify individuals is through the use of an implanted microchip, such as a Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag, which can be scanned and read.</p>

<h3>5.4 Routine Data Collection</h3>
<p>Information such as body measurements, weights, egg size and weight clutch size and growth should be collected and graphed over time in order to provide a better idea of reproduction and growth. Growth data should be collected every two to six months in order to interpret growth trends and detect health problems.</p>
