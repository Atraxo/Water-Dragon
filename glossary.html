<h1>Glossary</h1>
<p><strong>Agamid</strong>> – A member of the family Agamidae, one of the five families of Australian lizards commonly known as dragon lizards.</p>

<p><strong>Arboreal</strong> – Tree dwelling.</p>

<p><strong>Basking</strong> – Remaining in one location to receive heat or UV light from the sun or device.</p>

<p><strong>Thermo gradient</strong> – A difference in temperature (usually of about 10-12oC) over a measured area (such as an enclosure).</p>

<p><strong>Nuchal crest</strong> – A collection of spike located behind the head and back of the neck.</p>

<p><strong>Spinose scale</strong> – Scales of elongated and triangular appearance. Often coloured different to surrounding regular (non spinose) scales.</p>

<p><strong>Cloaca</strong> – singular vent located between the hind legs (or at the base of the tail in the case of snakes) occurring in amphibians, reptiles, monotremes and birds. Both the reproductive organs and the end of the digestive tract are located within this singular hole.</p>

<p><strong>Varanid</strong> – A member of the family Varanidae, one of the five families of Australian lizards commonly known as monitor or goanna lizards.</p>

<p><strong>Gravid</strong> – A female carrying eggs.</p>

<p><strong>Brumation</strong> – A phase in the life cycle as known as ‘hibernation’ whereby an animal becomes inactive, stops feeding and retreats from view into a secure hiding place (usually during colder months).</p>

<p><strong>Necrotic stematosis</strong> - Also known as Canker or Mouth rot, a bacterial infection effecting the jaw and or teeth of reptiles, often caused by an initial injury which exposes the area to infrction.</p>

<p><strong>Bacteria</strong> – One of the five kingdoms of life consisting of single cell prokaryotic (without nucleus) organisms which occur in all environments on earth and have a variety of ecologies. Some bacteria can create problems for both human (as a form of Zoonosis) and non-human animals.</p>

<p><strong>Supplements</strong> – Any added nutrient provided in addition to normal diet such as calcium and vitamins.</p>

<p><strong>Mites Snake Mite</strong> – Common species include Ophionyssus natricis, a parasitic Arachnid of concern to Herpteculturalists.</p>

<p><strong>Arachnid</strong> – An arthropod with two body segments and eight legs. This group also includes spiders, scorpions, ticks among others.</p>

<p><strong>Enclosure</strong> – An area with defined boundary.</p>

<p><strong>Hygiene</strong> – A desired state or required level of sanitation or cleanliness.

<p><strong>Protocol</strong> – A defined procedure of action to be taken under defined situations.</p>

<p><strong>Ventral</strong> - A term describing the bottom side of an animal or object.</p>

<p><strong>Dorsal</strong> - A term describing the top side of an animal or object.</p>

<p><strong>Lateral</strong> – A term describing one or more parallel sides of an animal or object (for example a an image of a dog standing on its side with tail at one end and head at the other is a lateral view).</p>

<p><strong>Zoonosis</strong> – An infection caused by contact with organisms such as viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi as well as internal and external invertebrate parasites.</p>

<p><strong>Antibiotics</strong> – Drugs used to kill bacterial and fungal infections.</p>

<p><strong>Substrate</strong> – Any loose or removable material used to cover the floor of an enclosure or garden area.</p>

<p><strong>Sloughing</strong> – The act of removing the outer cuticle of the skin in order to allow an animal to grow.</p>

<p><strong>Quarantine</strong> – A state of isolation intended to stop the spread of parasites and pathogens in the captive environment.</p>

<p><strong>Thermo-regulate</strong> – A process where an animal will move around its environment to attain a desired temperature. Basking will occur to warm up and hiding in the shade allows an animal to cool down. Animals such as reptiles will also regulate their behaviour and movements in order to thermo-regulate the best.</p>

<p><strong>Hemipenes</strong> – A pair of male sexual organs possessed by snakes and lizards.</p>

<p><strong>Squamata</strong> – The reptilian Order which snakes and lizards belong to, characterised by the presence of hemipenes.<p>

<p><strong>Nocturnal</strong> – Active mainly during the day.</p>

<p><strong>Diurnal</strong> – Active mainly during the day.</p>

<p><strong>Listlessness</strong> – Lack of normal activity as well as inability to sit, balance or rest without undue effort. Often a sign of stress, illness or injury.</p>

<p><strong>Oviposition</strong> - The deposition of eggs from a females body to the outside world, usually into a nest.</p>

<p><strong>Palpation</strong> – A gentle feeling around an animals body in order to detect the presence of eggs or any abnormalities within the body.</p>
