	<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
	<p>The Australian Water Dragon, <em>Intellagama lesueurii</em>, was first given the name Lophura lesueurii by John Edward Gray in 1831 and later placed into the genus <em>Physignathus</em> (Griffin 1831). The first description was based on the type specimen collected by French naturalist Charles-Alexandre Lesueur (whom the specific name honours) from Parramatta. The specimen was taken back to France on the Baudin expedition of 1800 (Ehmann 1992:134).This latin name translates literally as “Lesueur’s puffy jaw”. The genus <em>Physignathus</em> was described by George Cuvier (1769-1832) in 1829 based on the type specimen of the genus; <em>P. cocincinus</em> the Green Water Dragon of South-East Asia (Jenkins & Bartell 1980:90. De Vosjoli 1992:7), and refers to the inflated bulging of the jaw. Physignathus comprises two recognised species; P. lesueurii and P. concincinus. The Australian Water Dragon is Australia’s largest agamid lizard (Greer 1990:18), they can be found within and near most healthy riparian environments along the East coast of Australia as well as the upper reaches of the Murray-Darling basin (Ehmann 1992:134). Fossils belonging to the genus <em>Physignathus</em> and resembling the species I. lesueurii have been discovered in Miocene deposits in Riversleigh, Queensland, indicate that this genus has existed in Australia for at least 20 million years (Archer et al. 1994:78). </p>

	<p>The species was originally placed within the genus <em>Physignathus</em>. A closely related genus is <em>Hydrosaurus</em>, which includes the worlds largest Agamid; the Philippine Sail-Finned Water Dragon, <em>Hydrosaurus pustulatus</em> (Birkett & McCracken 1990). Both <em>Physignathus</em> and <em>Hydrosaurus</em> are very similar in habits but differ greatly in appearance due to the larger and more distinctive crests and dorsal sail featured in <em>Hydrosaurus</em> (De Vosjoli 1992:7). A later taxonomic review by Amey et. al. (2012) argued that  <em>P. cocincinus</em> and <em>P. lesueurii</em> were distinct enough to justify separate genera. Since <em>P. cocincinus</em> was described first it retained the use of the genus <em>Physignathus</em> and the Australian species was placed in the new genus; <em>Intellagama</em>. This species has been kept in Australian Zoo collections for quite some time and is reasonably represented in overseas collections in the well as private trade. The species is also familiar to many as free-ranging wild Water Dragons can often be found roaming the grounds of institutions such as Taronga Zoo and the Australian Reptile Park as well as many of the wildlife parks along the coastal regions of Queensland. Water Dragons are of particular display value as their habitats include aquatic, terrestrial, burrowing and arboreal adaptations. They can be used as an ambassador species for both forested and riparian environments and they are also a rather bold species that will tolerate significant human attention in areas where their habitats overlap with urban environments. </p>

<h3>WORK HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS</h3>
<p>The Australian Water Dragon, <em>Intellagama lesueurii</em>, is generally not an aggressive lizard to maintain in captivity; however, like all large Agamids they are capable of inflicting a severe bite when agitated. They can also use tail whips as a way to discourage unwanted attention when cornered. This species also possesses long sharp claws which can inflict serious lacerations which at minimum will require first aid or even medical treatment. Care should be taken to examine the individual animal’s temperament before entering the enclosure or restraining the animal. Please see the information on proper restraining techniques in section 7.3.
Other Work Health and Safety risks presented by keeping this species in captivity include exposure to cleaning chemicals, the possibility of burns from heating devices and ergonomic injuries from bending and overreaching.
Keeping Water Dragons also presents the same zoonotic risks presented by all animals in captivity; zoonotic infection can occur from contact with organisms such as viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi as well as internal and external invertebrate parasites. Such organisms can be transferred to humans through coming into contact with excrement, uneaten food particles, sloughed skin and dirty water from enclosure pools. Good hygiene practices should be followed including regular hand washing.</p>

<p>I wish to thank Steve Vogel, Roger Graf, and Rebekah Hosking for allowing me to use their amazing images of Water Dragon. For veterinary advice I would like to thank Dr David Vella from North Shore Veterinary Specialist Centre and Dr Robert Johnston from South Penrith Veterinary Clinic. Of great help was Ross Sadlier; Herpetology Collection Manager at the Australian Museum, whom provided me access to the Herpetology Library. Many thanks to Dr Hal Cogger (Australian Museum), Peter Harlow (Taronga Zoo) and Dr Glenn Shea (University of Sydney) for answering those few tricky questions and providing some direction. A big thank to Tom Vowell (Australian Reptile Park) who provided information about inter-species compatibility. Steve Vogel (Australian Museum) provided excellent  editorial advice and many hours of his own time proof reading the first draft. I would also wish to thank my patient and tolerant wife; Rebekah, who has put up with a tremendous amount of time without my full attention as I worked on the project as well as having to endure me talk about all things concerning the Genus <em>Intellagama</em>.</P>
