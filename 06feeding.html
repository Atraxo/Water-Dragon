<h1>6  Feeding Requirements</h1>
<p>The majority of dietary information found in the literature (Greer 2006) for this species is based on feeding observations of captive specimens, not based on observations of wild animals. Food items are often included as part of the ‘diet’ of Water Dragons based solely on whether a captive animal will feed on the item when it is presented. Keepers should be aware that many of these food items are not available in the wild or have never been observed as part of the diet of wild animals and therefore may not be nutritionally beneficial (Oftedal & Allen 1996).  Food items including Gambusia fish (P. Rankin in Anonymous 1976) and Water Skinks, Phenomorphus quoyii (G. Swan in Anonymous 1976) have been observed being eaten by Water Dragons, however it is not clear how commonly such food is consumed in the wild. Gippsland Water Dragons have been recorded feeding on the skink, Lampropholis delicata, in the wild (Meek et al. 2001a). More observations of wild feeding behaviour are required, however this species adaptability to captive diets are one of the factors that makes this species so hardy in captivity (Worrell 1966).</p>

<h3>6.1 Diet in the Wild</h3>
<p>Australian Water Dragons are completely insectivorous as juveniles with vegetation being consumed as they grow older and gradually increasing to make up almost half of the diet. Water Dragons have been observed in the wild feeding on the ground for insects such as ants (Greer 1990:19) as well as foraging amongst the branches of trees for arboreal invertebrates such as cicadas (P. Harlow in Anonymous 1976). The wild diet also includes molluscs and crustaceans (Wilson & Knowels 1992). Individuals have also been reported foraging for algae and crabs on intertidal zones in the Sydney region (Greer 1990:18). Juvenile Water Dragons have also been reported feeding on mosquitoes (M. Maddocks in Anonymous 1976) which they will jump in the air to catch. The herbivorous part of the diet observed being consumed in the wild includes figs, lily-pillies and flowers (Ehmann 1992).</p>

<p>In the wild Water Dragons are believed to forage underwater, however this is based on one observation (P. Rankin in Anonymous 1976) of diving Water Dragons returning to the surface and moving their jaws.<p>

<h3>6.2 Captive Diet</h3>
<p>The recorded food intake of this species in captivity is quite extensive. However it is recommended to provide adult Water Dragons with a variety (Phillips 2008:51-4) from the following three groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>Live Food – Snails, Yabbies, Feeder Cockroaches, Mealworms, Silkworms, and Crickets.</li>

<li>Meat - Whitebait, Young Mice, Rat Pinkies, Kangaroo Mince, as well as Canned Cat Food (jelly meat).</li>

<li>Vegetables – Peas, Corn, Carrot, Flowers (especially yellow flowers), Lettuce, Tomato, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Boc Choy, Spinach, Sweet Potato, Figs, Banana, Apple, Strawberries and Stone fruits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Water Dragons will also feed on commercially available Bearded Dragon Pellets (available from manufacturers such as ZooMed and ExoTerra). Food preferences can vary between individuals even those from the same clutch and raised with the same diet (per ob.)</p>
